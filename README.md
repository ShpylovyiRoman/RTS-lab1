## Usage
 Input start data:
According to my variant - 24:
  >Numbers of garmonics = 6
  ><br/>Border frequency = 2100
  ><br/>Number of points = 256

And for example I set 20000 iterations

<br/><br/>After waiting for processing, we get 4 graphs:
><br/>Random signals graph
><br/>Dependence of time graph
><br/>Crosscorrelation graph
><br/>Autocorrelation graph
